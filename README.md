# BOB

This was a small project of mine with the intention of creating an AI from scratch (it didn't end up very well as you can see).

I never finished it; nonetheless, I'm uploading it here for those who want to give it a try. You can download the code (sorry for the mess) or try the demo in the [Releases](https://github.com/FerLS/BOB/releases) section.

The project is currently abandoned; if someday I decide to continue it, I will update it here.
